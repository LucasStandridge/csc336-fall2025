# Lucas' Final

My app is a collection of all fully evolved pokemon, which allows the user to log in, curate favorites and teams, 
and come back to view them on the website.

I used the pokeapi that you used as a demo in class once, as well as Toast

I had a ton of fun making this, and did have to use the internet for some parts of the website, such as useNavigate and location, as well as some css help.

I also was unable to come up with a solution in time for making new teams while also clearing empty arrays in the useEffect, so all teams come with 1 pokemon to start with. I think its fine, and its definetely a not too hard solution, but I did not get around to it. 

Also, refreshing the page breaks it. I thin I need to check on every page if the user is logged in, and if they aren't, navigate to the login page to fix this. I did not get around to it.

I also originally planned on using mongoDB to store usernames, but again, did not get around to it. Im sorry, but your passwords are not safe with me.

I hope you enjoy.
