                <h3>Crunchy Boi</h3>
                    <p>

Onions, pickles, and shredded lettuce top that off, with a generous amount of balsamic oil to finish our most popular sandiwch. Simple but amazing, you can't go wrong with the Crunchy Boi.

                <h3>Teamster</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Teamster is our version of a classic italian sub.  Ham, capicola, and genoa salami go on this one, followed by provolone, italian sweet and hot peppers, onions, lettuce, and of course, balsamic oil. Another staple of any sandwich shop, our Teamster is an homage of the famous delis of New York and New Jersey.

                <h3>Marisa Tomei Eats Free</h3>
                    <p>
                        Named after the actress who one an Oscar in my favorite movie, the Marisa Tomei Eats Free is a light, refreshing sub, perfect for a hot day or those who don't have the stomach for one of our usually huge subs. Starting with our homemade honey chili aioli and followed a tasteful amount of capicola, and an above average serving of salami, the Marisa Tomei is defined by the arugula salad that is put on top of it. Tossed on the side with oil, chili flakes, oregano, onions, and a whole lot of basil, the salad goes right from the mixing bowl to the sandwich.
